# This is a scala client for [Warp10 Geo/time series DB](http://www.warp10.io/)

It based on the [http4s](http://http4s.org/) client, and the Pooled HTTP client, keeping TCP connection alive. Configuration of the Client is [here](http://http4s.org/api/0.14/index.html#org.http4s.client.blaze.BlazeClientConfig)

## Features

This client is able to send data to the warp10 DB ATM. It's the main purpose and usage for the time being, on my side there is no active work on fetching data, PR welcome.
